      It should be federally illegal to prosecute these guys on account of their green conservation efforts. On behalf of all the boys in blue (which I am not), I hereby grant them amnesety and permission to do whatever the hell they want to my speakers. Seriously, so many treats for the ears. Their first album especially hasn't betrayed my trust so far.<br><a href="https://cypresshill.com/">Official website here</a>

      If my buddies ushered me to the start line of a beer mile and then, after 4 laps and an equal number of chugs, attempted to test my nimbleness in a yoga session while thumbing down the list of geo-politics, American culture, consumerism, human tendency, etc., they would no longer be my buddies. Assholes. Somehow, Minutemen pull this off. On second thought, that actually sounds like a pretty memorable time.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_(band)">Wikipedia site here</a>

      Nobody raps quite like MF Doom. I mean, people have tried, but they ain't got it. There's a stamp of authenticity backed by his flexibility and referentially cryptic, syllabically slick style. Inimitable. Combine that with a variety of the dopest producers in hip-hop and the result is a bunch of really distinct, idea-packed albums with lots to chew on.<br><a href="https://gasdrawls.com/">Official website here</a>

      If most mainstream country acts are honestly acting, Sturgill Simpson is bare. Trustworthy in his grounded bewilderedness & sugarless coloring of observations, and the observations themselves. On the side of substance that allows him to be detailed, insightful, evocative, lucid, raw, conscious, and too active to sink into complacency. Plus, the instrumentation!
